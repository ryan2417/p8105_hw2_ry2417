## Problem 1

import and clean data in `Mr.Trash Wheel` sheet from
`Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx`

``` r
trashwheel_df <- 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    range = "A2:N406") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

import and clean data in `2018 Precipitation` and `2019 Precipitation`
from `Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx`

``` r
precipitation_2018_df <-
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(precipitation_inch = total) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precipitation_inch)) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_2019_df <-
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(precipitation_inch = total) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precipitation_inch)) %>% 
  mutate(year = "2019")
```

combine two precipitation data frames and convert month to a character
variable

``` r
precipitation_all_df <-
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018_df, precipitation_2019_df) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

describe these two data sets

``` r
some_example_trashwheel <- 
  trashwheel_df %>% 
  select(dumpster, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  head()

year_summary <- 
  trashwheel_df %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_weight_tons = sum(weight_tons), 
    average_weight_tons = mean(weight_tons), 
    total_volume_cubic_yards = sum(volume_cubic_yards),
    average_volume_cubic_yards = mean(volume_cubic_yards)
  )

median_sport_balls_2019 <- 
  trashwheel_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  pull(sports_balls) %>% 
  median()

some_example_precipitation <- 
  precipitation_all_df %>% 
  head()

max_precipitation <- 
  precipitation_all_df %>% 
  filter(precipitation_inch == max(precipitation_inch)) %>% 
  select(month, year) %>% 
  unlist()

min_precipitation <- 
  precipitation_all_df %>% 
  filter(precipitation_inch == min(precipitation_inch)) %>% 
  select(month, year) %>% 
  unlist()

sum_precipitation_2018 <- 
  precipitation_all_df %>% 
  filter(year == "2018") %>% 
  pull(precipitation_inch) %>% 
  sum()

sum_precipitation_2019 <- 
  precipitation_all_df %>% 
  filter(year == "2019") %>% 
  pull(precipitation_inch) %>% 
  sum()
```

## Problem 2

import and clean data in `pols-month.csv`

``` r
pols_df <- 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(
    mon, 
    into = c("year", "month", "day"), 
    sep = "-", 
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month],
    president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")
  ) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

import and clean data in `snp.csv`

``` r
snp_df <- 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(
    date, 
    into = c("month", "day", "year"), 
    sep = "/", 
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = ifelse(year <= 15, year + 2000, year + 1900),
    month = month.name[month],
  ) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

import and clean data in `unemployment.csv`

``` r
unemployment_df <-
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  rename_with(~ month.name, month.abb) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    January:December,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent_unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

join the data sets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and join the
`unemployment` to the result data frame.

``` r
merging_df <-
  pols_df %>% 
  left_join(snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

describe these data sets

``` r
max_stock_month <-
  merging_df %>% 
  filter(close == max(close, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(month, year, president) %>% 
  unlist()

min_stock_month <-
  merging_df %>% 
  filter(close == min(close, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(month, year, president) %>% 
  unlist()

max_unemployment_month <-
  merging_df %>% 
  filter(percent_unemployment == max(percent_unemployment, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(month, year, president) %>% 
  unlist()

min_unemployment_month <-
  merging_df %>% 
  filter(percent_unemployment == min(percent_unemployment, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(month, year, president) %>% 
  unlist()
  
some_example_merging <- 
  merging_df %>% 
  select(year, month, president, close, percent_unemployment) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(close)) %>% 
  head()
```

Data in `pols` has 822 observations of 9 variables. The year is ranging

Data in `snp` has 787 observations of 3 variables. The year is ranging
from 1950 to 2015.  
Data in `unemployment` has 816 observations of 3 variables. The year is
ranging from 1948 to 2015.  
The result data frame has 822 observations of 11 variables. The year is

The months with highest unemployment percentage are November, 1982 and
December, 1982, when the president was republican. The months with
lowest unemployment percentage is May, 1953 and June, 1953, when the
president was republican. The month with the highest closing values of
the S&P stock is May, 2015 when the president was democratic. The month
with the lowest closing values of the S&P stock is January, 1950 when
the president was republican.
